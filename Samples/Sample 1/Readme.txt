This sample contains a basic XMLSynchro configuration. 
This folder contains the master file XmlSynchro.Run.exe.XML, the executable XmlSynchro.Run.exe, the library XmlSynchro.dll and the referenced Microsoft CRM SDK files. 

\XmlSynchro.Run.exe is scheduled to run every day at 8:00am (the execution is triggered by the Task Scheduler).
The execution of XmlSynchro.Run.exe reads the master file XmlSynchro.Run.exe.XML and performs the sycnrhonisation processes defined in the <XMLIntegrationFile> nodes. 

.\LOG is configured to held the log files generated by each synchronisation process.
